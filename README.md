# idj-showcase

## What is this?

This project mostly holds code for both the backend and frontend used for showcasing the games produced by the students of the Introduction to Game Development course in University of Brasilia.

## Cool, what do you use?

The backend consists of 100% Haskell code, using the [Snap framework](http://snapframework.com/) while the frontend uses, mostly, a new language called Elm, which is pretty cool, [check it out](http://elm-lang.org)! To build the code, this project is using a tool called [Stack](http://haskellstack.org), which is an incredible alternative to cabal-install in the Haskell ecosystem.

For actually storing game information, this project is using [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/), which is, you guessed it, pretty nice and simple to use when you just need to store some simple data.

## So... why?

As you can probably tell, I'm a pretty big fan of functional programming and I'm doing this mostly to expand my knowledge of it. Another objective is to use these languages and tools for "real world" stuff in an attempt to further dispel the academic-ivory-tower fame Haskell has.

## What's the current status?

Currently, the project is still in active development. About 50% of the backend is finished. Most of the work remaining is in actually making a frontend for it.
